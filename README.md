I'm Guntak Kim(caput), master's student at Inha University, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering.  
My main interests are automation, networking, and cloud technologies—especially serverless computing. Currently, my research focuses on optimizing serverless cold starts.

I love exploring new technologies and building innovative services. Right now, I'm working on a toy project: an AI Agent based on MCP.  
While I enjoy development, I’m even more passionate about designing architectures for new services and refining them through hands-on experience. I learn the most when I realize my initial architectures need improvement and adapt them during development.

Personally, I believe the top-down approach is a great methodology, but whenever time allows, I prefer the bottom-up approach—starting from the fundamentals and principles, then building up step by step.

I’m also enthusiastic about sharing knowledge. I lead cloud study groups at IGRUS, a campus club, and frequently mentor at hackathons, offering advice based on my experiences.
